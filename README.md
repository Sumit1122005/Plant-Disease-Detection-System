# Plant-Disease-Detection-System

🌿 Plant Disease Detection System

📌 Overview

The Plant Disease Detection System is an AI/ML-powered application that identifies plant diseases from leaf images. The system utilizes deep learning models to analyze images and provide accurate disease predictions, helping farmers and agriculturists take early preventive actions.

🚀 Features

📷 Image-Based Detection – Upload a leaf image to detect plant diseases.

🤖 AI/ML Model – Uses a trained deep learning model for high accuracy.

📊 Disease Classification – Identifies different plant diseases with confidence scores.

🌱 Healthy vs. Diseased – Distinguishes between healthy and infected leaves.

📡 User-Friendly Interface – Simple UI for easy interaction.


🏗 Tech Stack

Programming Languages: Python

Frameworks & Libraries: TensorFlow/Keras, OpenCV, NumPy, Pandas

Model: CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)

Deployment: Flask/FastAPI (for web-based API) or Android/iOS app (if applicable)


🔧 Setup & Installation

1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/plant-disease-detection.git
cd plant-disease-detection


2. Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt


3. Run the application:

python app.py



🎯 How It Works

1. Upload a leaf image.


2. The AI model analyzes the image.


3. The system predicts the disease and suggests possible remedies.



📌 Future Improvements

🏆 Improve model accuracy with more dataset training.

🌍 Deploy a mobile/web application.
